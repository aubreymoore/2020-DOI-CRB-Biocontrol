\section{Project Description}

This grant proposal is a request for funds to hire a post doctoral
entomologist for 2 years to work on an existing project to implement
effective biological control for the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB)
which is rapidly killing palm trees in Guam and Palau. Without significant
population suppression of CRB in Guam and Palau, it is likely that
Guam and Palau will lose most of their palms and it is just a matter
of time before other Micronesian Islands are invaded by CRB. 

\subsection{Background}

\paragraph{The coconut rhinoceros beetle, \emph{Oryctes rhinoceros}, is a major
pest of coconut palm, oil palm and other palm species.}

Palms are damaged when adult beetles bore into the crowns of palms
to feed on sap. Tree mortality occurs when beetles destroy the growing
tip (meristem). Immature beetles (grubs) do no damage. They feed on
dead, decaying vegetation in breeding sites. Preferred breeding sites
are dead, standing coconut stems, and piles of decaying vegetation
such those left behind by typhoons or after replanting of oil palm
plantations. If a CRB population is not suppressed, it is possible
for a positive feed-back cycle to initiate whereby adult beetles kill
massive numbers of palms, thereby generating more food for even more
grubs which turn into adults which kill even more palms. An outbreak
following this scenario occurred in the Palau Islands during the late
1940s resulting in about 50\% coconut palms being killed by CRB throughout
the archipelago and 100\% mortality on some of the smaller islands
(\cite{gressitt_coconut_1953}). A similar outbreak is currently impacting
Guam.

\paragraph{Following 40 years of no geographical range expansion, CRB is again
``on the move'' in the Pacific.}

CRB was recently detected for the first time at several Pacific Island
locations including Saipan (2006), Guam (2007), Port Moresby, Papua
New Guinea (2010), Oahu, Hawaii (2013), and Honiara, Solomon Islands
(2015). Eradication of CRB has been attempted many times but is extremely
difficult, having been achieved only once, on Niuatoputapu (formerly
known as Keppel Island), a tiny island belonging to Tonga, with an
area of only 16 km\textsuperscript{2} (3\% the area of Guam) (\cite{catley_coconut_1969}).
Failing eradication, the usual response to CRB infestations during
the second half of the 20th century was introduction of \emph{Oryctes}
nudivirus (OrNV), the biological control agent of choice for this
pest \cite{jackson_use_2009-1} . OrNV attacks only CRB, typically
reducing damage by up to 90\% with population suppression lasting
indefinitely (\cite{bedford_g._o._long-term_2013}). OrNV is auto-disseminated,
meaning the pathogen is carried between feeding and breeding sites
by CRB adults. Like many biocontrol agents, OrNV is density-dependent,
working best at high population densities. After release, OrNV suppresses
CRB populations to levels that result in only minor damage. 

\paragraph*{Current invasions of Pacific Islands by CRB involve a new invasive
biotype that has escaped from biological control by OrNV. }

Discovery of OrNV nudivirus in the 1960s enabled the successful management
of CRB populations in Pacific Island Countries (\cite{huger_oryctes_2005-1}).
Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism
for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For
\textasciitilde{}40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy,
no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing
islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. 

However, the situation has recently changed. For the first time in
40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported.
Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g.
Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage.
Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage
by beetles not seen since the introduction of OrNV. 

Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were
unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the population
that invaded Guam is tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied
OrNV isolates. Subsequent DNA analysis showed that the Guam population
is genetically different from other populations in the region. On
the basis of distinct genetics and tolerance to currently available
OrNV isolates, the Guam population has been designated a new biotype,
CRB-Guam (CRB-G) (\cite{marshall_new_2015,marshall_new_2017-1}).

Recent analysis of DNA from an ongoing survey has detected CRB-Guam
in Guam, Hawaii, Palau, Port Moresby (PNG) and Honiara (Solomon Islands).
Thus, current invasions in the Pacific involve the CRB-Guam biotype
and it is expected that these populations are tolerant to all available
isolates of OrNV. 

\paragraph*{Uncontrolled infestations of CRB-G may kill most palms within a few
years and risk of accidental spread to other islands is high.}

A worse case scenario may be triggered by a massive outbreak of adult
CRB emerging from abundant breeding sites made by large amounts of
decaying vegetation left in the wake of a typhoon (such as Typhoon
Dolphin which visited Guam in May, 2015). Very high feeding activity
will kill mature coconut palms, leaving standing dead coconut trunks
that are ideal breeding sites for subsequent generations of beetles. 

During a CRB outbreak, there will be an increased risk of further
spread to uninfested islands throughout the Pacific. Palms are important
on Pacific Islands for various reasons: as a cash crop for nuts, oil
and lumber, as an ornamental tree appreciated by residents and tourists.
On some of the smaller, more traditional islands the coconut palm
is referred to as \emph{the tree of life}. Here, this species is an
essential natural resource providing income, housing, food, oil, soap,
clothing, mats, baskets, and other containers. The smaller, poorer
Pacific islands will suffer the most if the spread of CRB-Guam cannot
be controlled. If CRB-G infests islands and atolls where the coconut
palm as the \emph{tree of life}, islanders may have to migrate to
larger population centers.

\paragraph*{Recommended response to CRB-G invasions.}

Entomologists working on the CRB-G problem agree that the most feasible
way to prevent massive palm mortality during outbreaks is establishment
of biological control using an isolate of OrNV which is highly pathogenic
to CRB-G (\cite{jackson_need_2015,vaqalo_pest_2015}).
%\cite{jackson2015needfor,vaqalo2015anemerging,marshall2016whitepaper}. 

The concensus among Pacific-based entomologists is that the most feasable
way to stop massive palm mortality during CRB-G outbreaks is to find
a find and release a have met several times to plan a response to
CRB-G invasions. In a special meeting on CRB-G at the XXVth International
Congress of Entomology 
%\cite{2016newcoconut}
, the following strategic
plan was suggested:

A coordinated regional project should be organized and adequately
staffed and funded to accomplish 3 objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item Survey CRB populations throughout the Asian/Pacific region to delimit
the geographical distribution of CRB-G and identify its centre of
origin.

\item Survey CRB-G populations from the centre of origin to find isolate(s)
of OrNV (or other pathogens) that are highly pathogenic for the CRB-G
biotype.

\item Implement \emph{in vivo} or \emph{in vitro} propagation of selected
OrNV isolates for auto-dissemination on islands infested with CRB-G.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Recent progress.}

A regional CRB-G biocontrol project has not yet been established because
funding sources have not been identified.

However, despite relatively scant resources, a USDA-APHIS funded collaboration
between the University of Guam and AgResearch New Zealand has made
progress on all 3 objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item DNA samples from CRB populations collected in Asia indicate the presence
of the CRB-G biotype in the Philippines and Indonesia.
\item During a UOG/AgResearch expedition to Negros Island, Philippines in
January 2017, about 100 DNA samples from a known CRB-G population
were collected.
\item Lab tests in at AgResearch New Zealand indicated that all sampled
beetles belonged to the CRB-G biotype and that one of these was infected
with OrNV. The OrNV from this beetle was isolated and propagated insect
cell culture.
\end{enumerate}
We are hoping that this OrNV isolate will kill CRB-G adults, to be
determined in bioassays to be performed on Guam. We are currently
waiting for APHIS to issue an import permit to allow shipment of a
sample of the new isolate from New Zealand to Guam. If the isolate
proves pathogenic for CRB-G, we will immediately start \emph{in vivio}
propagation and auto-dissemination.

\subsection{Statement of Need}

This proposal requests funds to hire a post doctoral entomologist
for 2 years to implement effective biocontrol for CRB. Technical/scientific
assistance in the form of a post doc is necessary because professional
capacity to handle major entomological problems in Micronesia is inadequate.
During the past 2 decades the number of PhD level entomologists practising
in Micronesia decreased from 9 (5 in Guam, 3 in CNMI, 1 in Palau)
to 3 (all in Guam). During this same period the workload increased,
mainly because the detection rate for invasive species went up by
almost an order of magnitude. The three remaining PhD level entomologists
in Micronesia do not have time and resources to adequately respond
to concurrent invasions of coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire
ant, Asian cycad scale, and several major agricultural pest insects.
Teaching and administrative responsibilities do not allow enough time
to be dedicated to finding solutions to the major entomological problems
currently impacting Micronesia. The post doctoral entomologist will
work under supervision of the PI within an existing CRB biocontrol
program funded by USDA-APHIS. 

Funding of the current proposal will enable extension of benefits
from the Guam biocontrol project to Palau.

A regional project with the objective of developing effect biological
control for CRB was identified as an urgent need by Micronesian Governors
and Presidents at the 22nd Micronesian Islands Forum which took place
on Guam during May, 2017 (Appendix \ref{sec:Extracts-from-the}).

\subsection{Goals and Objectives}

The post doctoral entomologist will work on an existing project to
implement effective biological control for the coconut rhinoceros
beetle, Guam biotype (CRB-G) which is rapidly killing palm trees in
Guam and Palau. The overall objective of this project is establish
a self-sustaining biological control which will stop palm tree mortality
and eventually suppress the CRB to minimize damage to tolerable levels. 

Details for the following goals can be found in the approved APHIS
project work plan attached as Appendix \ref{sec:Work-Plan-for}.

\subsubsection{Perform lab bioassay to determine pathogenicity of the new OrNV isolate
from Negros Island, Philippines}

If this new isolate is not pathogenic for CRB-G, further foreign eploration
will be necessary.

\subsubsection{Establish an island-wide coconut palm health survey}

This semiannual health survey will quantify CRB damage to coconut
palms on an islandwide basis. The survey needs to be started prior
to auto-dissemination of OrNV or other control tactic is implemented
so that results can be evaluated.

\subsubsection{Establish a CRB rearing facility to provide adults}

Field collected results will be reared in environmental rearing cabinets
for use in bioassays, \emph{in vivo} propagation of OrNV and auto-dissemination.
One rearing cabinet has been ordered. Two more will be ordered with
FY17 Farm Bill funds.

\subsubsection{Establish biological control of CRB-G by auto-dissemination of OrNV
in Guam and Palau}

CRB-G adults will be used to autodisemminate OrNV in Guam and Palau.

\subsection{Potential Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item This project will directly benefit Guam and the Republic of Palau.
Both of these jurisdictions are infested with CRB-G. Without implementation
of effective biological control, it is likely that 50\% or more coconut
palms will be killed by CRB-G.
\item This project will indirectly benefit all other islands in Micronesia.
With very high populations of CRB-G in Gaum and the Republic of Palau,
risk of accidental introduction to other islands is extremely high.
CRB-G has already been intercepted twice on Saipan, Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands. If CRB-G infests islands and atolls
where the coconut palm as the \emph{tree of life}, islanders may have
to migrate to larger population centers.
\item Foreign exploration leading to discovery of a highly pathogenic strain
of OrNV or other microbial biocontrol agent for CRB-Guam could lead
to implementation of self sustaining population suppression and tolerable
damage levels on Guam and other islands invaded by CRB-G. 
\item Loss of 50\% or more of Guam's palms may be prevented if an effective
biocontrol agent is found and released quickly. 
\item Reduction in CRB population levels on Guam will reduce the risk of
accidental of the highly invasive CRB-Guam biotype to other Pacifc
islands and elsewhere. 
\item Development of image analysis methods may lead to a small, inexpensive,
automated CRB damage detector which could be mounted on a drone or
a conventional vehicle. This device could be used for early detection
or monitoring of CRB damage.
