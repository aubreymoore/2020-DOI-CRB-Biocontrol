Project Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This grant proposal is a request for funds to hire a post doctoral entomologist
 for 2 years to work on an existing project to implement effective biological
 control for the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) which is rapidly killing
 palm trees in Guam and Palau.
 Without significant population suppression of CRB in Guam and Palau, it
 is likely that Guam and Palau will lose most of their palms and it is just
 a matter of time before other Micronesian Islands are invaded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros
\emph default
, is a major pest of coconut palm, oil palm and other palm species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palms are damaged when adult beetles bore into the crowns of palms to feed
 on sap.
 Tree mortality occurs when beetles destroy the growing tip (meristem).
 Immature beetles (grubs) do no damage.
 They feed on dead, decaying vegetation in breeding sites.
 Preferred breeding sites are dead, standing coconut stems, and piles of
 decaying vegetation such those left behind by typhoons or after replanting
 of oil palm plantations.
 If a CRB population is not suppressed, it is possible for a positive feed-back
 cycle to initiate whereby adult beetles kill massive numbers of palms,
 thereby generating more food for even more grubs which turn into adults
 which kill even more palms.
 An outbreak following this scenario occurred in the Palau Islands during
 the late 1940s resulting in about 50% coconut palms being killed by CRB
 throughout the archipelago and 100% mortality on some of the smaller islands

 in the Pacific.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB was recently detected for the first time at several Pacific Island locations
 including Saipan (2006), Guam (2007), Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2010),
 Oahu, Hawaii (2013), and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015).
 Eradication of CRB has been attempted many times but is extremely difficult,
 having been achieved only once, on Niuatoputapu (formerly known as Keppel
 Island), a tiny island belonging to Tonga, with an area of only 16 km
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 (3% the area of Guam)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "catley1969thecoconut"

\end_inset

.
 Failing eradication, the usual response to CRB infestations during the
 second half of the 20th century was introduction of 
\emph on
Oryctes
\emph default
 nudivirus (OrNV), the biological control agent of choice for this pest
  .
 OrNV attacks only CRB, typically reducing damage by up to 90% with population
 suppression lasting indefinitely 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bedford2013biology"

\end_inset

.
 OrNV is auto-disseminated, meaning the pathogen is carried between feeding
 and breeding sites by CRB adults.
 Like many biocontrol agents, OrNV is density-dependent, working best at
 high population densities.
 After release, OrNV suppresses CRB populations to levels that result in
 only minor damage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Current invasions of Pacific Islands by CRB involve a new invasive biotype
 that has escaped from biological control by OrNV.
 (
\backslash
cite{Marshall2015}).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discovery of OrNV nudivirus in the 1960s enabled the successful management
 of CRB populations in Pacific Island Countries 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "huger2005theoryctes"

\end_inset

.
 Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for
 CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions.
 For ~40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks
 of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing islands in the Pacific
 ensuring continuity of palm based village economies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the situation has recently changed.
 For the first time in ~40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas
 has been reported.
 Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g.
 Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage.
 Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage by
 beetles not seen since the introduction of OrNV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedl
y unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the population that invaded
 Guam is tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates.
 Subsequent DNA analysis showed that the Guam population is genetically
 different from other populations in the region.
 On the basis of distinct genetics and tolerance to currently available
 OrNV isolates, the Guam population has been designated a new biotype, CRB-Guam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent analysis of DNA from an ongoing survey has detected CRB-Guam in Guam,
 Hawaii, Palau, Port Moresby (PNG) and Honiara (Solomon Islands).
 Thus, current invasions in the Pacific involve the CRB-Guam biotype and
 it is expected that these populations are tolerant to all available isolates
 of OrNV.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*

\backslash
section*{Worst Case Scenario}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Uncontrolled infestations of CRB may kill most palms within a few years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A worse case scenario may be triggered by a massive outbreak of adult CRB
 emerging from abundant breeding sites made by large amounts of decaying
 vegetation left in the wake of a typhoon (such as Typhoon Dolphin which
 visited Guam in May, 2015).
 Very high feeding activity will kill mature coconut palms, leaving standing
 dead coconut trunks that are ideal breeding sites for subsequent generations
 of beetles.
 During a CRB outbreak, there will be an increased risk of further spread
 to uninfested islands throughout the Pacific.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palms are important on Pacific Islands for various reasons: as a cash crop
 for nuts, oil and lumber, as an ornamental tree appreciated by residents
 and tourists.
 On some of the smaller, more traditional islands the coconut palm is referred
 to as 
\emph on
the tree of life
\emph default
.
 Here, this species is an essential natural resource providing income, housing,
 food, oil, soap, clothing, mats, baskets, and other containers.
 The smaller, poorer Pacific islands will suffer the most if the spread
 of CRB-Guam cannot be controlled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*

\begin_layout Standard
A coordinated regional collaboration should be organized and adequately
 staffed and funded to accomplish 3 objectives:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The population of coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB) first detected on Guam
 in 2007 is genetically distinct from other populations of this major palm
 pest and it is being referred to as the CRB-G biotype.
 CRB-G is resistant to all available isolates of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV),
 which is the major biocontrol agent for CRB, and it appears to have other
 characteristics, which make it more invasive and harder to control than
 other CRB biotypes.
 While there where no range expansions of CRB for a quarter of a century
 (1980 to 2005), CRB is now on the move with the invasion of Guam in 2007,
 the Port Moresby area of Papua New Guinea in 2009, Oahu, Hawaii in 2013,
 and the Honiara area of Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands in 2015.
 It is significant that all of these new invasions involve CRB-G.
 Thus, CRB-G is a regional problem, with Guam currently experiencing massive
 mortality of coconut palms as the result of a CRB population explosion
 triggered by abundant larval breeding sites left in the wake of a recent
 typhoon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB-G has also been found in Palau which is seeing a ressurgence of CRB
 damage.
 Palau was invaded by CRB during WWII and lost more than half of its coconut
 palms before OrNV was introduced as a biological control agent.
 Following introduction of OrNV, CRB damage fell to almost indetectable
 levels 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 [REFS].
 The current resurgence in CRB damage in Palau is thought to be caused almost
 exclusively by the virus resistent CRB-G biotype 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this project is to stop an uncontrolled outbreak of coconut
 rhinoceros beetle biotype G which is rapidly killing palms on Guam.
 Entomologists working on this problem agree that the most feasible solution
 is establishment of biological control using an isolate of OrNV which is
 highly pathogenic to CRB-G [REFS].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Financial assistance will facilitate: 1.
 continued support of an international collaborative project with the goal
 of discovering a strain of OrNV or other microbial biocontrol agent which
 is highly pathogenic for CRB- Guam 2.
 continued support for a graduate research assistant at the University of
 Guam 3.
 continued support for operating an insect pathology laboratory at the Universit
y of Guam to evaluate candidate biocontrol agents discovered during foreign
 exploration 4.
 support for a semiannual island-wide coconut palm health survey for Guam
 Items 1, 2 and 3 are currently supported by my FY2016 Farm Bill (performance
 period: August 1, 2016 through July 30, 2017).
 Item 4, which establishes a semiannual coconut palm tree health survey,
 is a new activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Statement of Need
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This proposal requests funds to hire a post doctoral entomologist for 2
 years to implement effective biocontrol for CRB.
 Technical/scientific assistance in the form of a post doc is necessary
 because professional capacity to handle major entomological problems in
 Micronesia is inadequate.
 During the past 2 decades the number of PhD level entomologists practising
 in Micronesia decreased from 9 (5 in Guam, 3 in CNMI, 1 in Palau) to 3
 (all in Guam).
 During this same period the workload increased, mainly because the detection
 rate for invasive species went up by almost an order of magnitude.
 The three remaining PhD level entomologists in Micronesia do not have time
 and resources to adequately respond to concurrent invasions of coconut
 rhinoceros beetle, little fire ant, Asian cycad scale, and several major
 agricultural pest insects.
 Teaching and administrative responsibilities do not allow enough time to
 be dedicated to finding solutions to the major entomological problems currently
 impacting Micronesia.
 The post doctoral entomologist will work under supervision of the PI within
 an existing CRB biocontrol program funded by USDA-APHIS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Funding of the current proposal will enable extension of benefits from the
 Guam biocontrol project to Palau.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A regional project with the objective of developing effect biological control
 for CRB was identified as an urgent need by Micronesian Governors and President
s at the 22nd Micronesian Islands Forum which took place on Guam during
 May, 2017 (Appendix

Potential Benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This project will directly benefit Guam and the Republic of Palau.
 Both of these jurisdictions are infested with CRB-G.
 Without implementation of effective biological control, it is likely that
 50% or more coconut palms will be killed by CRB-G.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This project will indirectly benefit all other islands in Micronesia.
 With very high populations of CRB-G in Gaum and the Republic of Palau,
 risk of accidental introduction to other islands is extremely high.
 CRB-G has already been intercepted twice on Saipan, Commonwealth of the
 Northern Mariana Islands.
 If CRB-G infests islands and atolls where the coconut palm as the 
\emph on
tree of life
\emph default
, islanders may have to migrate to larger population centers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign exploration leading to discovery of a highly pathogenic strain of
 OrNV or other microbial biocontrol agent for CRB-Guam could lead to implementat
ion of self sustaining population suppression and tolerable damage levels
 on Guam and other islands invaded by CRB-G.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Loss of 50% or more of Guam's palms may be prevented if an effective biocontrol
 agent is found and released quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduction in CRB population levels on Guam will reduce the risk of accidental
 of the highly invasive CRB-Guam biotype to other Pacifc islands and elsewhere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Development of image analysis methods may lead to a small, inexpensive,
 automated CRB damage detector which could be mounted on a drone or a convention
al vehicle.
 This device could be used for early detection or monitoring of CRB damage.
